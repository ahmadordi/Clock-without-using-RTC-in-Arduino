# Clock without using RTC with temperature and humidity indicator (Arduino)

This small code will work as clock and also it will show the temperature and humidity using the DHT11 temperature and humidity Module.
I used 3 buttons to be able to set the clock. 

You will need these pieces for this project:
1. Arduino Uno Board
2. Button x3
3. Potentiometer
4. LCD 1602 Module (With pi header)
5. DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Module
6. Breadboard
7. Some jumper wires
